			Hey baby, boo boo, darling, honey, bunny, my loml (and I'm your loyl)(Also, not Keerthana so u better pick her a new nickname ), shona baby (idc if it's cringe)!<br /><br />			Do you remember the day we first met?<br />
			<span class="comments">// Outside of our class when u approached me(idc if this is cringe for) </span><br />
			Since that day a spark begun;<br />
			<span class="comments">// Your face, your Voice, your Words, your fucking cuteness..</span><br />
			You're everything got imprinted in my heart;<br />
			As the time went on;<br />
			The Bond grew stronger and stronger and the weaker cuz shit happened and ukw it was and then it grew way stronger;<br />
			Journey from Infatuation(i saw this word in a reel) to Love;<br />
			We have traveled a long way together;<br />
			We had our downs (fights) ;<br />
			<span class="comments">// And I'm sure there will be more.</span><br />
			We had more ups than downs and our bond will ofc grown more<br />
			<br>
			<br>
			All I want to say is<br />
			Baby I love you more than words can say, more than there are hours in time.<br />
			7th may the day we confessed to each other, the night i was the happiest.<br />
			ahhh, fucking baby uk how much i happy i was(ew) wtv <br />
			anyways, yeah talking about when i started loving you <br />
			it was when we started talking all day, like nonstop<br />
			the way u got mad when i didn’t say good morning(we didnt wish each other gm today) properly or good night properly or when my tone was just a bit off<br />
			u’d full go silent and i'd be like i messed up again didnt i<br />
			and ur eyes?? wtf baby ur eyes r like some sort of black hole they just suck me in and i don’t even wanna escape<br />
			and today when u cried at every small thing ahhh i wanted to hold u so tight and tell u it’s okay like 500 times<br />
			i hate when u cry but also love that ur so soft and emotional like that’s so pure and real fr<br />
			and your lips??? like wtf how do u even look that good when ur annoyed or mad it makes me wanna kissu and shut u up<br />
			ur cuteness is fucking illegal istg, like why are u this cute AND this annoying at the same time<br />
			and when u (used to) send me voice notes with that lil pouty voice i just die then come back to die again<br />
			baby idc how much u scream or cry or fight i still wanna stay<br />
			cuz u make me feel like home, even when ur being mean<br />
			even when u roast me 24/7 or act like a baby at 12am<br />
			i still choose u. every time. always. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Now If you want to hug me you can touch the heart below<br />
